This github repo contains my PCB projects.

## Printed Circuit Board(PCB) Workshop

The workshop was held at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo, participants were guided through the comprehensive process of manually crafting a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), from the initial design phase in software to the physical realization involving drilling and soldering. The centerpiece of this hands-on session was the construction of a simple yet effective audio amplifier circuit, centered around the versatile LM386 Integrated Circuit (IC). The design phase is done in Proteus because most students at the faculty are familiar with the software.

For educational purposes, we opted to design the PCB as a single-layer board with through-hole components. While it's feasible to construct a more compact version, we intentionally enlarged the board's dimensions. This decision was made to accommodate a safer and more participant-friendly drilling experience. Ensuring ease of handling and reducing the risk of errors during the manual drilling process were our primary considerations, making the workshop accessible and engaging for attendees, regardless of their prior experience with PCB fabrication.

## Ultrasonic Speaker

The PCB developed was a component of my Bachelor's Thesis, which focused on creating an ultrasonic directional speaker. To achieve this, I employed a digital modulation method utilizing an STM32 Nucleo microcontroller. Specifically, I designed a custom shield equipped with all necessary components to interface with the Nucleo board. Additionally, I designed an ultrasonic phased array to facilitate the directional output of ultrasonic waves. The PCB was made in Eagle software.
